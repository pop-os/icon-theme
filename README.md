Pop_Icons
================

Pop_Icons is the icon theme for Pop!_OS. It uses a semi-flat design with raised 3D motifs to help give depth to icons. 

Pop_Icons take inspiration from the Adwaita GNOME Icons.

## Downloading Pop

It is recommended to install Pop_Icons through your system package manager, e.g.:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pop-icon-theme
```

If your OS does not package Pop_Icons, you can install them from git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pop-os/icon-theme pop-icon-theme
cd pop-icon-theme
meson build
sudo ninja -C "build" install
```

By default it installs to `/usr/`, but you can specify a different directory with a prefix like `/usr/local` or `$HOME/.local`, for example:

```sh
meson -Dprefix=$HOME/.local build
ninja -C "build" install
```

After which you should be able to pick Pop as your icon or cursor theme in GNOME Tweaks, or you can set either from a terminal with:

```bash
# set the icon theme
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme "Pop"
# or the cursor theme
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme "Pop"
```

### Uninstalling Pop

To uninstall Pop, simply run the following. (If you installed it without superuser priveleges just omit the  `sudo`.)

```bash
sudo ninja -C "build" uninstall
```

Once uninstalled you can reset your icon and cursor theme to the default setting by running the following.

```bash
# reset icon theme to default
gsettings reset org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme
# reset cursor theme to default
gsettings reset org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme
```
